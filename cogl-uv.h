 *
 * Cogl needs to integrate with the application's main loop so that it
 * can internally handle some events from the driver. libuv provides
 * an efficient, portable mainloop api that many projects use and
 * so this is a convenience API that can be used instead of the
 * more low level cogl-poll api.
