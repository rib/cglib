/**
 * SECTION:cg-meta-texture
 * @short_description: Interface for high-level textures built from
 *                     low-level textures like #cg_texture_2d_t and
 *                     #cg_texture_3d_t.
 *
 * CGlib helps to make it easy to deal with high level textures such
 * as #cg_atlas_texture_t<!-- -->s, #cg_sub_texture_t<!-- -->s,
 * #cg_texture_pixmap_x11_t textures and #cg_texture_2d_sliced_t textures
 * consistently.
 *
 * A #cg_meta_texture_t is a texture that might internally be
 * represented by one or more low-level #cg_texture_t<!-- -->s
 * such as #cg_texture_2d_t or #cg_texture_3d_t. These low-level textures
 * are the only ones that a GPU really understands but because
 * applications often want more high-level texture abstractions
 * (such as storing multiple textures inside one larger "atlas"
 * texture) it's desirable to be able to deal with these
 * using a common interface.
 *
 * For example the GPU is not able to automatically handle repeating a
 * texture that is part of a larger atlas texture but if you use
 * %CG_PIPELINE_WRAP_MODE_REPEAT with an atlas texture when drawing
 * with cg_framebuffer_draw_rectangle() you should see that it "Just
 * Worksâ„¢" - at least if you don't use multi-texturing. The reason
 * this works is because cg_framebuffer_draw_rectangle() internally
 * understands the #cg_meta_texture_t interface and is able to manually
 * resolve the low-level textures using this interface and by making
 * multiple draw calls it can emulate the texture repeat modes.
 *
 * CGlib doesn't aim to pretend that meta-textures are just like real
 * textures because it would get extremely complex to try and emulate
 * low-level GPU semantics transparently for these textures.  The low
 * level drawing APIs of CGlib, such as cg_primitive_draw() don't
 * actually know anything about the #cg_meta_texture_t interface and its
 * the developer's responsibility to resolve all textures referenced
 * by a #cg_pipeline_t to low-level textures before drawing.
 *
 * If you want to develop custom primitive APIs like
 * cg_framebuffer_draw_rectangle() and you want to support drawing
 * with #cg_atlas_texture_t<!-- -->s or #cg_sub_texture_t<!-- -->s for
 * example, then you will need to use this #cg_meta_texture_t interface
 * to be able to resolve high-level textures into low-level textures
 * before drawing with CGlib's low-level drawing APIs such as
 * cg_primitive_draw().
 *
 * <note>Most developers won't need to use this interface directly
 * but still it is worth understanding the distinction between
 * low-level and meta textures because you may find other references
 * in the documentation that detail limitations of using
 * meta-textures.</note>

 *
 * Allows you to manually iterate the low-level textures that define a
 * given region of a high-level #cg_meta_texture_t.
 *
 * For example cg_texture_2d_sliced_new_with_size() can be used to
 * create a meta texture that may slice a large image into multiple,
 * smaller power-of-two sized textures. These high level textures are
 * not directly understood by a GPU and so this API must be used to
 * manually resolve the underlying textures for drawing.
 *
 * All high level textures (#cg_atlas_texture_t, #cg_sub_texture_t,
 * #cg_texture_pixmap_x11_t, and #cg_texture_2d_sliced_t) can be handled
 * consistently using this interface which greately simplifies
 * implementing primitives that support all texture types.
 *
 * For example if you use the cg_framebuffer_draw_rectangle() API
 * then CGlib will internally use this API to resolve the low level
 * textures of any meta textures you have associated with cg_pipeline_t
 * layers.
 *
 * <note>The low level drawing APIs such as cg_primitive_draw()
 * don't understand the #cg_meta_texture_t interface and so it is your
 * responsibility to use this API to resolve all cg_pipeline_t textures
 * into low-level textures before drawing.</note>

 * For each low-level texture that makes up part of the given region
 * of the @meta_texture, @callback is called specifying how the
